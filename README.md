<h1>A thousand word speller</h1>

## Project summary
A thousand word speller project consists in a BCI system based on the P300 paradigm, which allows users to create and generate art by combining different concepts or images into a new artistic image. The main objective of this tool is to assist users who have lost some or all of their motor functions to create art by using their brain waves. This project was presented at [BR41N.IO hackathon Spring School 2023](https://www.br41n.io/Spring-School-2023) and won 2nd place in the category BCI programming & arts. Here's the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKrOSglzkWM) to the project presentation on Youtube.
